# COVID NLP resources

In this Github repository we provide dictionaries which include COVID symptom terms for multiple languages (currently English and Greek). Our resources can be used to identify possible COVID cases via product review, regarding smell, taste or hearing.

## Use case scenario

As presented in the following [link](https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/people-are-leaving-1star-reviews-of-scented-candles-seemingly-unaware-they-have-covid/), customers have rated poorly products with 1-star, without a reasonable cause. In the case presented previously, customers were rating candles with 1-star, as they were not getting the expected smell of the candles. The seller started to suspect that something is going on. After some time, the seller correlated the loss of smell with COVID, since one of the first symptoms coming with COVID is loss of smell. The seller then contacted the customers, notifying them that there is a chance that the they cannot smell due to having COVID. The customers afterwards were tested for COVID and found positive.
